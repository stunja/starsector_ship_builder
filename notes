## Issues to solve

1. Builder Center

<!-- - when clicking on a weapon, to add to the ship, it overwrites the weapon slot class/type.
  should be unchangable. For example Hybrid should stay Hubrid.
  - to Solve I need to add purposeString, to specify the purpose of the background sprite element -->

<!-- - I need to add rocket sprite to rocket turret base -->

- # No, too hard. Rockets are not in packs, but as separate enteties. Not sure how to even implement them, performance issue is going to be massive. Low priority

<!-- - Correctly rotate Weapons. -->

- Composite Weapon Slot: Issue in hover effect

2. Weapon

<!-- - Filter doesnt work. Should Filter by category.
  When I click on the category it eventListener Dont work -->
<!-- TODO I removed the filters -->

<!-- - Active Weapon Should Be fixed at the top of the weapon selection screen. -->
<!-- - Issue with Active class, when clicking on sorting button -->

- Weapon Slot is still bugged, I need to make sure it is properly pop up properly works after I add weapon. Currently parent container blocks mouse clicks
- Issue with PopUpContianerHeader, for example COST, you have to click cost two times.

- Tons of visual bugs
<!-- - Fighter PopUp Issue with remove active class from Fighter -->

- If I hover over already placed weapon, should display hover information.

3. Weapon Pop Up Hover

<!-- - Fix Alignment of weapon Icon -->
<!-- - Fix Sprite Icons -->
<!-- - add icon for damage type -->

<!-- - Issue with data. For example Beam weapons -->

- When you close open pop up, first position is bugged on Hover
- Small Issue with hover animation, due to different size of hover container and table
  -- Issue is due to size container, current implementation is a MESS

3. Hullmod Menu Pop Up

- I dont remember, but something was bugged there with hullmods. Either incorrect hullmod features.
- I need to go over every hullmod effect, and check if conditions are correct.
- The way it is implemented is nightmarefuel. I do need to fully rework them.

4. Fighters

<!-- - Fetch Fighters -->
<!-- - Inject Additional Information into Fighters -->
<!-- - Add / Remove Active Selection  -->
<!-- - Sort Function -->

<!-- - Handler Close on External Click -->
<!-- - Handler Click to Add  -->

<!-- - handle and Button to Close form -->
<!-- - Handler Hover on Weapon, give additional info -->
<!-- - I need to fix description for fighters, way to long, I need similiar approach to weapons (1sentence max) -->
<!-- - Adding Fighter Icon -->
<!-- - Weapon equiped on Fighter, WHEN ARE THEY? (15/12/24) -->

<!-- - Show Fighter Active Slot (Green or Blue Border || grey out the other slots) -->
<!-- - Display Multipul fighters in the same slot -->

- If I hover over already placed fighter, should display hover information.

## Things to Do

<!-- - Weapon Slot Arcs -->
  <!-- I need to make two lines, vertical, and a sphere. So I can make a single border on the top part of the arch -->

- Weapon Slot With Weapon, when hovering display basic info like name / type / range.
- Fighters
<!-- - Skills (Cool idea, just copy hullmod effect, maybe after project is finished.) -->

- Smods Menu (Just copy hullmods with a different paint)
- HullMod Menu close if clicked outside of the hullMod pop up

## Weapon Slot Types

- Mount Types
- Name Icon Supported weapon types Support smaller weapons
- Ballistic Yellow Square Ballistic Yes
- Energy Blue Circle Energy Yes
- Missile Green Diamond Missile Yes
- Hybrid Orange Square-in-Circle Ballistic / Energy Only Hybrid weapons
- Composite Lime Diamond-in-Square Ballistic / Missile Only Composite weapons
- Synergy Turquoise Diamond-in-Circle Energy / Missile Only Synergy weapons
- Universal Grey Diamond-in-Square-in-Circle All Only Universal weapons

- Medium & Large mounts can accommodate a weapon one size smaller, but only if it has the same type as the mount.
- For example, a medium ballistic mount can fit a small ballistic weapon, and a medium hybrid mount can fit a small hybrid weapon (see below), but a medium hybrid mount cannot fit a small ballistic or energy weapon.
- Certain weapons have a combination weapon type (Hybrid, Composite or Synergy). Such weapons can go in a matching combination mount, a mount matching one of the two underlying basic types, or a Universal mount.

- Hybrid weapons can fit in Ballistic, Energy, Hybrid or Universal mounts.
- Composite weapons can fit in Ballistic, Missile, Composite or Universal mounts.
- Synergy weapons can fit in Energy, Missile, Synergy or Universal mounts.
