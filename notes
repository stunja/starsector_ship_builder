## Issues to solve

1. Builder Center

<!-- - when clicking on a weapon, to add to the ship, it overwrites the weapon slot class/type.
  should be unchangable. For example Hybrid should stay Hubrid.
  - to Solve I need to add purposeString, to specify the purpose of the background sprite element -->

<!-- - I need to add rocket sprite to rocket turret base -->

- No, too hard. Rockets are not in packs, but as separate enteties. Not sure how to even implement them, performance issue is going to be massive

<!-- - Correctly rotate Weapons. -->

2. Weapon Pop Up

<!-- - Filter doesnt work. Should Filter by category.
  When I click on the category it eventListener Dont work -->
<!-- TODO I removed the filters -->

<!-- - Active Weapon Should Be fixed at the top of the weapon selection screen. -->
<!-- - Issue with Active class, when clicking on sorting button -->

- Weapon Slot is still bugged, I need to make sure it is properly pop up properly works after I add weapon. Currently parent container blocks mouse clicks
- Issue with PopUpContianerHeader, for example COST, you have to click cost two times.

- Tons of visual bugs
<!-- - Fighter PopUp Issue with remove active class from Fighter -->

3. Weapon Pop Up Hover

<!-- - Fix Alignment of weapon Icon -->
<!-- - Fix Sprite Icons -->
<!-- - add icon for damage type -->

## Shit to Do

## Weapon Slot Types

- Mount Types
- Name Icon Supported weapon types Support smaller weapons
- Ballistic Yellow Square Ballistic Yes
- Energy Blue Circle Energy Yes
- Missile Green Diamond Missile Yes
- Hybrid Orange Square-in-Circle Ballistic / Energy Only Hybrid weapons
- Composite Lime Diamond-in-Square Ballistic / Missile Only Composite weapons
- Synergy Turquoise Diamond-in-Circle Energy / Missile Only Synergy weapons
- Universal Grey Diamond-in-Square-in-Circle All Only Universal weapons

- Medium & Large mounts can accommodate a weapon one size smaller, but only if it has the same type as the mount.
- For example, a medium ballistic mount can fit a small ballistic weapon, and a medium hybrid mount can fit a small hybrid weapon (see below), but a medium hybrid mount cannot fit a small ballistic or energy weapon.
- Certain weapons have a combination weapon type (Hybrid, Composite or Synergy). Such weapons can go in a matching combination mount, a mount matching one of the two underlying basic types, or a Universal mount.

- Hybrid weapons can fit in Ballistic, Energy, Hybrid or Universal mounts.
- Composite weapons can fit in Ballistic, Missile, Composite or Universal mounts.
- Synergy weapons can fit in Energy, Missile, Synergy or Universal mounts.
