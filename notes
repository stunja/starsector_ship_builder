## Issues to solve

1. Builder Center

<!-- - when clicking on a weapon, to add to the ship, it overwrites the weapon slot class/type.
  should be unchangable. For example Hybrid should stay Hubrid.
  - to Solve I need to add purposeString, to specify the purpose of the background sprite element -->

2. Weapon Pop Up

<!-- - Filter doesnt work. Should Filter by category.
  When I click on the category it eventListener Dont work -->
<!-- TODO I removed the filters -->

- Active Weapon Should Be fixed at the top of the weapon selection screen.
- Tons of visual bugs

3. Hullmod Menu Pop Up

- I dont remember, but something was bugged there with hullmods. Either incorrect hullmod features.

## Shit to Do

- Weapon Slot Arcs
  I need to make two lines, vertical, and a sphere. So I can make a single border on the top part of the arch
- Weapon Slot With Weapon, when hovering display basic info like name / type / range.

- Smods Menu
- HullMod Menu close if clicked outside of the hullMod pop up

## Weapon Slot Types

- Mount Types
- Name Icon Supported weapon types Support smaller weapons
- Ballistic Yellow Square Ballistic Yes
- Energy Blue Circle Energy Yes
- Missile Green Diamond Missile Yes
- Hybrid Orange Square-in-Circle Ballistic / Energy Only Hybrid weapons
- Composite Lime Diamond-in-Square Ballistic / Missile Only Composite weapons
- Synergy Turquoise Diamond-in-Circle Energy / Missile Only Synergy weapons
- Universal Grey Diamond-in-Square-in-Circle All Only Universal weapons

- Medium & Large mounts can accommodate a weapon one size smaller, but only if it has the same type as the mount.
- For example, a medium ballistic mount can fit a small ballistic weapon, and a medium hybrid mount can fit a small hybrid weapon (see below), but a medium hybrid mount cannot fit a small ballistic or energy weapon.
- Certain weapons have a combination weapon type (Hybrid, Composite or Synergy). Such weapons can go in a matching combination mount, a mount matching one of the two underlying basic types, or a Universal mount.

- Hybrid weapons can fit in Ballistic, Energy, Hybrid or Universal mounts.
- Composite weapons can fit in Ballistic, Missile, Composite or Universal mounts.
- Synergy weapons can fit in Energy, Missile, Synergy or Universal mounts.
